# Product-Management-System MVC JBDC

Developed a Product Management System in Java to efficiently handle product operations such as adding, removing, updating, and fetching product details.
Employed Created a user-friendly command-line interface for interacting with the system and Implemented functionalities for adding single or multiple products with dynamic availability tracking.
Implemented updates for product name, price, and quantity, ensuring seamless modification of product details.
Integrated robust error handling and input validation to enhance system reliability.
In the fast-paced world of business and technology, efficient management of products is essential for success. A well-designed Product Management System (PMS) can streamline the processes involved in handling products, from creation and tracking to sales and inventory management. In this context, adopting a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture along with Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) can provide a robust and scalable solution.

1. Purpose of the System:
The Product Management System aims to provide a centralized platform for businesses to manage their products effectively. It facilitates the organization, tracking, and analysis of various aspects related to products, including inventory, sales, and customer interactions.

2. Architecture Overview:
2.1 Model-View-Controller (MVC):
Model: Represents the data and business logic of the application. In our PMS, it includes classes for handling products, inventory, and database interactions using JDBC.

View: Deals with the presentation and user interface. It displays the data from the model and sends user inputs back to the controller. Views in our system will showcase product details, sales reports, and inventory status.

Controller: Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. It processes user inputs, updates the model, and refreshes the view accordingly. Controllers in our PMS will handle user interactions, such as adding new products, updating inventory, and generating sales reports.

2.2 Java Database Connectivity (JDBC):
JDBC will be used to establish a connection between the PMS and a relational database. It enables the storage and retrieval of product-related data, such as product details, inventory levels, and sales records. A well-designed database schema will be crucial for efficient data management.

3. Key Features:
Product Management: Create, update, and delete product details, including name, description, price, and quantity.

Inventory Control: Track and manage product inventory, set minimum stock levels, and receive alerts for low stock.

Sales Tracking: Record and analyze sales transactions, generate reports, and view trends over time.

User Authentication: Implement secure login mechanisms to control access to sensitive product and sales data.

Database Integration: Utilize JDBC to interact with a relational database for storing and retrieving product-related information.

4. Benefits:
Efficiency: Streamline product management processes, reducing manual efforts and minimizing errors.

Accuracy: Ensure accurate and up-to-date information about products, inventory, and sales.

Scalability: Designed with scalability in mind, the system can handle growing product catalogs and increasing transaction volumes.

Data-driven Decisions: Generate reports and analytics to aid in decision-making processes related to product strategies and sales.

In summary, the Product Management System using MVC and JDBC provides a structured and efficient approach to handle the complexities of product management in a business setting. This system aims to enhance productivity, ensure data accuracy, and support informed decision-making for businesses dealing with a variety of products.
